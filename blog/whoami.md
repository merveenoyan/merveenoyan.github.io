I define myself as an Aegean (🍋) above everything. I'm an immigrant living in Paris for the past 4 years. When you're an immigrant living alone, you `<think></think>` and read a lot, so I decided to write this blog. 

**Few facts:**
- More than half of my life I've been doing [photography](https://www.instagram.com/1855mmcliches/). Less than half of my life I enjoyed cinema.
- I love reading fiction & philosophy. These days I'm reading [Byung Chul Han](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/970747.Byung_Chul_Han).
- Throughout my life I learnt different sports. Last decade I sticked to strength training, and lately I started running. I also learnt how to surf and snowboard this year.
- In my free time I am writing a book with my friends on [vision language models](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/vision-language-models/9798341624030/) published by O'Reilly. I have read a ton of O'Reilly books at the beginning of my career and it helped me a lot, so I wanted to do something on my end. 

## tech work

I work in Hugging Face open-source team. I have developed features for, documented, yapped about a variety of libraries, primarily in vision & multimodality. Hugging Face is the type of place where what you _do_ matters. I have written about what I do in [Build in Public](../build_in_public.md) blog.
