I define myself as an Aegean (🍋) above everything. I'm an immigrant living in Paris for the past 4 years. When you're an immigrant living alone, you `<think></think>` and read a lot, so I decided to write this blog. 

**Few facts:**
- More than half of my life I've been doing [photography](https://www.instagram.com/1855mmcliches/). Less than half of my life I enjoyed cinema.
- I love reading fiction & philosophy. These days I'm reading [Byung Chul Han](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/970747.Byung_Chul_Han).
- Throughout my life I learnt different sports. Last decade I sticked to strength training, and lately I started running.
- In my free time I am writing a book with my friends on [vision language models](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/vision-language-models/9798341624030/) published by O'Reilly. I have read a ton of O'Reilly books at the beginning of my career and it helped me a lot, so I wanted to do something on my end. 

## tech work

I work in Hugging Face open-source team. I have developed features for, documented, yapped about a variety of libraries, primarily in vision & multimodality. Hugging Face is the type of place where what you _do_ matters. 

- One of the favorite parts of my job is getting access to shiny models before they're released, testing or training them makes me realize how far we progress in open-science every time. You can find some of them in my [Hugging Face Articles](https://huggingface.co/merve/activity/articles).
- Sometimes paradigm changes, I like to fill in and work on interesting problems. For instance early 2025 I integrated vision capabilities to smolagents and which unlocked a light open agentic web browser ([read here](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents-can-see)). 

**Some of the things I worked on and found interesting:**
- I have noticed, despite the ease of use of the libraries at Hugging Face, giving people scripts to do things helps them a ton. So I developed [smol-vision](https://github.com/merveenoyan/smol-vision) which is loved by community (1.8k ⭐️). Currently I don't have the bandwidth to update this, once book is done, more will come.

I am passionate about getting devs started with open-source models and tooling fast, so I like compiling everything they need to know:
- [VLMs](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms) and [2025 Update](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms-2025)
- [A blog about OCR models](https://huggingface.co/blog/ocr-open-models)
- [Quantization](https://huggingface.co/blog/merve/quantization)
